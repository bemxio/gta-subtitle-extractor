# gta-subtitle-extractor
A simple script, written in Python, for converting an '.xml' file with the subtitles' time and duration, and an '.oxt' file with the actual subtitle content, retrieved from the [GTA V's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V) files, using [OpenIV](https://openiv.com/).

It was tested for [Princess Robot Bubblegum](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Robot_Bubblegum) only, however it should work for other movies/cutscenes in the game.

## Running
Make sure you're running Python 3.7+ before doing any steps.

1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice.
2. Move to the directory with the files in a terminal.
3. Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required requirements.
4. Done! To check the usage of the script, do `python3 main.py -h`.
